In this task I have been provided with a " Global Terrorism" data set with contains all the major criminal activities that happened all around the world during 1970 to 2017 .
It was an very challenging data set since it contain 135 columns, 181695 rows or raw data . It was a new experience working with such a big data set and it helped me gain a lot of experience . 

Steps taken to Process the data :

Analysis of the data : 
Since the data set is huage analysing and identifying the important column that add value to the data set is important. The remaining data can me dropped since they do not make any valuable impression in the processing.
I filtered 18 columns that I felt important.

Data cleaning: 
 Even though the important columns are separated the rows may have missing and duplicate values.
Addressing this issue and over coming it is very important because it may affect the accuracy of the data.

EDA :
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

Conclusion:
I have gathered a conclusion from the visualisation and statistic information that
